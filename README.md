# Alcohol by Volume (ABV) Calculator

Program to calculate the ABV of a drink given the amount and alcohol percentage of the ingredients.

The program will prompt the user to specify the amount of alcoholic and non-alcoholic ingredients, then the program will step through gathering information about each ingredient. For the alcoholic ingredients it asks for the amount in fluid ounces (fl/oz) and the alcohol percentage of that ingredient. For the non-alcoholic ingredients it only asks for the amount in fluid ounces.

The program will then output the ABV of the specified ingredients along with the total liquid amount in fluid ounces.

The program also does comparisons for other drinks to help gauge the strength of the entered ingredients.
